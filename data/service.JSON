    "serviceDetails": "If you have one or more missing teeth, your dental professional may recommend that you get artificial replacements. There are removable options like dentures that you can take out and clean, but those can slide around, shift, or fall out â€“ which understandably won't fly for many people. And that's why there are crowns affixed to dental implants and bridges which function more like your actual teeth.",

The implant fixture is first placed so that it is likely to osseointegrate, then a dental prosthetic is added.",
